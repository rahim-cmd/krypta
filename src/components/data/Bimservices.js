Over the past decade, we’ve delivered more than 1,100 projects for and 300+ satisfied clients across the globe. At Krypta Tech, we don’t just build models; we help our clients bring their ideas to life more clearly and efficiently with intelligent, data-driven 3D BIM models.

        Our BIM Modeling Services are designed for architects, engineers, contractors, developers, and owners who want to boost accuracy & improve coordination in their architectural, structural, MEP, facade, landscape, and As-Built 3D Modeling projects. We work globally across a variety of sectors, including residential, commercial, retail, hospitality, industrial, infrastructure, data centers, & mission-critical facilities. Depending on the required Building information modeling output, we develop detailed BIM building modeling for LOD 100 (Concept Design), LOD 200 (Coordination & Schematic Design), LOD 300 (Coordination & BOQ/BOM), LOD 400 (Coordination, Fabrication, Scheduling & Shop Drawings), and LOD 500 (As-Built).

       Our expert team uses advanced tools like Autodesk Revit, Navisworks, and BIM 360 to develop models that comply with international standards (ADA, IBC, NFPA, ASHRAE, and SMACNA). Every model designed and developed undergoes rigorous in-house QA & QC checks to ensure the highest quality delivery. Our integrated BIM approach supports clash detection, 4D (scheduling) & 5D (cost estimation), which results in lower costs, better project control, and faster delivery for every client.`,
