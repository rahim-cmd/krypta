Over the past decade, we’ve delivered more than 1,100 projects for and 300+ satisfied clients across the globe. At Krypta Tech, we don’t just build models; we help our clients bring their ideas to life more clearly and efficiently with intelligent, data-driven 3D BIM models.

        Our BIM Modeling Services are designed for architects, engineers, contractors, developers, and owners who want to boost accuracy & improve coordination in their architectural, structural, MEP, facade, landscape, and As-Built 3D Modeling projects. We work globally across a variety of sectors, including residential, commercial, retail, hospitality, industrial, infrastructure, data centers, & mission-critical facilities. Depending on the required Building information modeling output, we develop detailed BIM building modeling for LOD 100 (Concept Design), LOD 200 (Coordination & Schematic Design), LOD 300 (Coordination & BOQ/BOM), LOD 400 (Coordination, Fabrication, Scheduling & Shop Drawings), and LOD 500 (As-Built).

       Our expert team uses advanced tools like Autodesk Revit, Navisworks, and BIM 360 to develop models that comply with international standards (ADA, IBC, NFPA, ASHRAE, and SMACNA). Every model designed and developed undergoes rigorous in-house QA & QC checks to ensure the highest quality delivery. Our integrated BIM approach supports clash detection, 4D (scheduling) & 5D (cost estimation), which results in lower costs, better project control, and faster delivery for every client.`,

    content:`Our as-built documentation service delivers a reliable replica of existing on-site conditions using high-quality 3D laser scanning. With the help of this raw scan data, we create accurate architectural, structural, and MEP as-built information, providing perfect dimensions, details, and layout that represent the actual built environment. These outputs help architects, engineers, and contractors understand existing conditions clearly, reducing the risk of on-site surprises during renovation, retrofitting, or construction planning.

We provide 2D & 3D deliverables that incorporate floor plans, sections, and elevations generated from point clouds, as well as 3D surface meshes & models. We make sure these as-built data integrates with top BIM tools such as AutoCAD & Revit, and also provide the final deliverables in DWG, PDF, Revit (LOD 100–500), RCP/RCS, E57, and other standard formats to support seamless integration into your workflow.`,

    title:"Industrial & Plant Scanning",
    content:`We provide top-quality 3D laser scanning for complex facilities such as manufacturing plants, refineries, oil and gas sites, power stations, and process lines in our industrial & plant scanning service. Our experts capture all the existing conditions in detail, including piping networks, valves, structures, equipment, and overall layouts, so teams have a clear and reliable picture of what’s on site.
This precisely captures site data, is used to plan upgrades, retrofits, maintenance work, and plant expansions with less error. By understanding existing conditions upfront, teams can improve safety, reduce downtime, and avoid unexpected clashes during execution. Scan data is processed into clean, well-registered point clouds and further developed into practical 2D and 3D outputs for engineering and construction use. Deliverables typically include plans, sections, elevations, 3D models, clash reviews, deviation studies, and BIM-ready models compatible with AutoCAD, Revit, Navisworks, and other common industry tools. These outputs give project teams dependable information to coordinate better and work more efficiently throughout the project lifecycle.`,
